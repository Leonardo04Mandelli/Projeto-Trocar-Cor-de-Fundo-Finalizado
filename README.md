My first Project in HTML, CSS and JavaScript - Finished
The project aims to show my knowledge in HTML, CSS and JavaScript with a simple change of the page's background color.
Color change modes:
1 - input field with the name of the color;
2 - input field with random color;
3 - text field for the user to type and apply the name of a color in written and hexadecimal form;
4 - input field for the user to choose the color using RGB and apply it to the page;
5 - file input field for the user to upload an image and apply it to the page background.
